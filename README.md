ckanext-hierarchy - Organization hierarchy for CKAN
===================================================

Provides templates to arrange CKAN organizations into a tree hierarchy,
display organiations in this hierarchy instead of a flat list, and
propagate some administrative priviledges downwards in the hierarchy.

/organization - now shows the organization hierarchy instead of list
/organization/about/{id} - includes the hierarchy relating to the particular organization

TODO:
* allow editing of a tree's parent
* make the trees prettier with JSTree
